### Introduction


Like most of history's overland empires, the Russian Empire relied on animal-powered relays (or "posts") to run its official communications.  The princes of Moscow began to organize this service in the late 15th century.  They established relay stations at regular intervals along important roads (generally 15-25 miles apart).  They required local communities to maintain fresh horses at these stations.  (At some stations, dogs, reindeer, human rowers or even porters provided this horse-power.)  Bouncing up to such a relay station and producing an official post-order, the Tsars' couriers and servitors could claim these horses at these stations, as well as new coachmen and vehicles to work them. Regular mail service was added along these roads in the late seventeenth century.  Starting under Peter I (1689-1725), civilians could purchase post-orders and travel and send mail through these postal roads as well. [^1]

For nearly three hundred years (ca. 1480-1780), the imperial Russian government seems to have paid little attention to the architecture of these relay stations.  Local communities, as far as we can tell, housed the posts inside their own wooden homes and courtyards, or built separate huts and outbuildings for them on the same model.  In 1782, however, the St. Petersburg government sent provincial governors a stately new set of neoclassical designs for the empire's post offices. Their author was Nikolai L'vov (1753-1804), a Russian nobleman and servitor in the imperial College of Foreign Affairs.

A copy of one of these plans—a model district post-yard, designed by L'vov—is preserved today in the Russian State Historical Archive (RGIA, St. Petersburg).[^2]  As a primary source, this model plan illuminates an important juncture in the history of imperial Russian communications.  It allows us today to explore just how the architects of Russia's Enlightenment sought to house the ancient imperial obligation of relay service within their plans for the empire's future.

This micro-edition will present an annotated digital facsimile of this plan, based on an archival photograph taken by the Russian State Historical Archive in 2010.   An accompanying essay will situate this design within L'vov's life as an architect, the Catherinean government's attempts to reform Russia's provinces, and the longer, imperial history of communications in Russia.

# About this Source

Nikolai Aleksandrovich L'vov was born on his family's serf estate, in northwest Russia, in 1751. At the age of sixteen, he left for St. Petersburg, and enrolled as an artilleryman in the prestigious Izmailovsky Regiment.  Before long, however, he transferred to civil service in the Empire's College of Foreign Affairs, under the protection of the powerful diplomat Petr Vasilievich Bakunin.  At Bakunin's house, he was surrounded by enthusiasts for the latest European fashions in literature, music, theater, and art.  Young L'vov himself rapidly earned a reputation as a gifted "genius of taste," showing remarkable talent in all of these areas.  His education into a Renaissance man of Russian Enlightenment culture was completed in 1776-1777, when he accompanied an ailing patron on a tour around Europe, including stops in Cologne, the Netherlands, London, Paris, Madrid, and Rome.[^1]

Upon his return to Russia, L'vov acquired a powerful new client: Aleksandr Andreevich Bezborodko (1747-1799).  Like L'vov, Bezborodko (from a cossack family in Ukraine) had gotten his start in St. Petersburg in the College of Foreign Affairs.  By 1780, however, he had become Catherine II's personal secretary and *de facto* chancellor.  No piece of correspondence—foreign or domestic—reached the empress without first passing through Bezborodko's hands, and the empress relied upon him to execute her most important plans.  Bezborodko, in turn, came to depend on the talented L'vov to help realize them.[^2]

In December of 1781, Catherine made Bezborodko the Director of Russia's Postal Department.  She simultaneously gave him a big job.[^3]  Catherine was completing a major reform of how the empire was governed, intended to "make easier the best and most precise execution of those beneficial acts promulgated hereafter."[^4] To wit, Catherine had divided her empire's vast provinces into 33 smaller units of local administration, which could work with local elites to govern local societies more closely and respond more quickly to central commands.  These new local governments (or 'provinces,' as they are called in English) each had a centrally-appointed governor, a capital city, and a provincial office with clerks and officers to serve it. (By Catherine's death the number of provinces had grown to 41.)[^5]

Catherine's vast expansion of local imperial governance demanded an equally dramatic expansion of Russia's postal roads.  Merely connecting all the new provincial capitals and district towns with St. Petersburg and Moscow meant multiplying the number of relay stations and post offices many times over.  Yet Catherine wanted regular (weekly) mail deliveries and on-demand transportation services through a much more refined network than that.  She ordered Bezborodko (and the governors of the new provinces) to plan a system of five interlocking levels. The first would connect the chief city of each province to the two imperial capitals; the second would connect the cities of neighboring provinces; the third—each provincial city with its district towns; the fourth—district towns with one another; and the last each district town all the way back up to St. Petersburg and Moscow.[^6]

The number of relays—and the burden of maintaining them—grew correspondingly.  In 1769 (before the provincial reform) there were 574 relay stations in the Russian Empire, according to one trustworthy account.  By 1801, there were 3,222.  Most of these stations—known simply as *stantsii* or *stany*—were simple stops where local people would provide 2-4 horses and 1-2 coachmen for relay service.  Even so, this required a seven-fold increase in the number of horses harnessed for relay duty, from 4,895 (in 1775) to 37,840 (in 1801).  In addition, the number of post offices—known as *pochtovye kontory* ('post offices') or *pochtovye dvory* (post-yards)—grew rapidly as well.  These offices were found in provincial capitals and district towns.  They marked the terminus of mail routes (street delivery did not begin in the Russian Empire until the nineteenth century), and also housed the postmasters who oversaw district and provincial mails more generally.  In 1781, there were 73 such post offices in the empire. By 1801, there were 450. [^7]

From the beginning, Catherine claimed to be worried about the burdens this increased postal service—born, as in centuries past, by local subjects as a form of imperial obligation—might place on the new provincial society.  She told her governors that they should seek every means to place the new stations on the most profitable footing possible.  By collecting fees for services—such as letter mail, travel by post, food and shelter, and money transfers—they should in time be able to make the posts pay for themselves (or so she claimed).  In the meantime, she instructed Bezborodko that the construction of local post offices should be paid for out of the funds she had allocated each province for "public buildings."[^8]

To create designs for these locations, Bezborodko turned to L'vov.  It is not entirely clear how, or even when, the young man acquired his architectural training.  During his European journey of 1776-1777, L'vov saw many major European cities and no sketched and took notes about what he saw.  His first major project—a cathedral to commemorate the meeting between Catherine and the Habsburg Emperor Joseph II in 1780—pleased the Russian Empress greatly.  She sent him abroad again, this time to study art and architecture in earnest for six months, mostly in Italy.  When he returned, he brought a beautiful four-volume edition of Andrea Palladio's _The Four Books of Architecture_ with him.  Across the next two decades, he became one of neoclassical architecture's great exponents in Russia, building dozens of public buildings, churches, and civilian estates in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Tver Province.[^9]
